These are the steps to partition the hard drive.
1. Type sudo fdist -l
Using this identify the drive to partion. It will look like /dev/sd_

2. Type sudo gdisk
3. Enter the location of the drive (/dev/sd_)
4. Hit x (for extra options)
5. Hit z (this zaps the disk)
After zapping this should bring you back to the start of gdisk (after entering /dev/sd_ I think)

6. Now hit o (This will erase all the partitions on the drive)
7. Now hit w (This will write all the above to the disk).
8. Exit gdisk and restart (Not sure this is necessary).
9. Enter gdisk (sudo gdisk)
10. Enter /dev/sd_ for location of drive to partion
11. Enter n (to create a new partition) (Note: I am a little iffy on the following)
12. Hit enter for the default
13. Hit enter for the default (Start of EFI partition)
14. Enter +128M (End of EFI partion)
15. The code for EFI partion is ef00
16. Hit n for new partition
17. Hit enter for default
18. Enter +128M (leaves a little bit of space between EFI partion and OS)
19. Enter -10M (leaves a little extra space at end of disk. This means the whole disk will hold the linux operating system)
20. Hit enter. THe default code should be the code for linux.
21. Enter w to write everything to the disk.
22. Type sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/ds__ -n -ESP (the __ is the letter and number of the efi partion. The number should be 1)
Now you can install ubuntu on this drive
