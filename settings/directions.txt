Note:

The qtcreator.desktop goes in: /usr/share/applications directory.
Copy the stuff in terminator_config.txt into a file named config in ~/.config/terminator/ directory (just config not config.xxx)
The settings.json file is the settings.json for my VS Code stuff. It goes in the following directories:
-Linux: ~/.config/Code/User/
-macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/
